*"People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That is how they define 'Reality'. But what does it mean to be 'correct' or 'true'? They are merely vague concepts... Their 'Reality' may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to be simply living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?" - Itachi Uchiha*
